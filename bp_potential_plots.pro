; scatter plot with size vs.
;   wavelength/temp, time, (both? two values on opposite axes!)


; Countours
; Temporal plots
; Difference images
; "Summed must be same cc too!" ... ??
; Add and/or average all images together
; Plot all relationships for single wavelength/bandpass
;   e.g. six panels, images of intensity, cc, tt, plots for all 3 relationships
